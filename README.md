# ACADEMIC PROJECTS
•	Student Data Organizer (Java): built using Array List and data is taken from user, output in table format. 
•	Student Data (C++): built using Linked list, takes data and organizes from text, outputs data back to text format. 
•	Controllable Crossbow: built using Arduino along with team-based activities. 
•	Decrypting a Substitution Cipher (C): a program that intakes a text and deciphers it based on the letter repetition. 
•	The Exam Scheduler (C): program schedules students exam time using bit wise manipulation and makes sure there are no collisions. 
•	Num Puz (Java, Swing): A number puzzle game, moves the clicked number into the empty slot until all numbers are sorted. Built using Swing in Java, based on the MVC design. 
•	 Nagini (C, Compiler): Interpreter compiler, translates Nagini language into a parser using C.
•	 Tax Grocery Calculator (Java, Android Studio): Grouped with Weiwei Chan to build the application within the span of one sprint, app takes in prices, calculates, and dynamically displays the total price. The user can individually select if the item includes taxes or not within the app, can delete and duplicate the items. 
•	 Bridal Wear (JS, React, Node, Mongo DB): A team-based project with a group of 6, worked with Client Abby Greenberg to create a Bridal clothing customization. Project used the MERN stack, react as the front end handled by all group members, Node for back end and express to set up the back-end server handled by me, Mongo DB for a simple database also handled by me, front end design by Haroun Benmeddour.  
•	 Fans & sports car Subscription (C#, .Net): Handled a subscription-based service created using .Net. Project used Db context and migrations to handle the database, and a blob service for news regarding Sport. Using LINQ queries the fans and sports club can view their subscriptions, and Fans can Subscribe or unsubscribe from sports. 
•	 Tic Tac To (Java, Swing): Project created to help introduce beginners to java programming, made in command line by printing the array board and changing the character of each spot to player moves, and for GUI interface was once again created using swing. 
•	 Metronome (C, Resource manager): Using a Resource manager in QNX operating system written using Momentics IDE program can take a tempo and start printing based on the tempo. Using commands, the user can change the set tempo and the second path metronome_help prints instructions set. Project was made with assistance of Haroun Benmmedour. 
•	 Exam Scheduler using binary masks (C): 
o	Uses a single Unsigned long integer 64-bit size to schedule a two week, 8 hours daily exam. 
o	Converts time and day given into the correct bit representation in the variable. 
o	Checks for time collisions and provides free time slots. 
•	 Digital counter (Arduino, shift register and Teensy board): 
o	Uses Teensy board 4.0, two shift registers, resistors, and two seven segment displays, and a pull-down switch. 
o	Runs till a specific number and resets after reaching it. 
o	The second version of this project runs from 0 till 9 and when the player presses the button, the number is displayed for 2 seconds and starts running again. If the player presses the button again on the same number, the number blinks and if a different number is pressed, the display turns off for 2 seconds.  
•	 Temperature Display (Node red, Arduino): 
o	Version 1: using Node red, a RESTful API is set up that can display the current temperature settings of the board. 
o	Version 2: Using a seven-segment display in Arduino, the project can display the current temperature of the room, by displaying h for heat, L for low and n for normal. 
•	 Heartbeat Display (JEE, React, NetBeans & glassfish): 
o	Using Jakarta EE, implements a Heartbeat Game Web Application and RESTful HTTP API to do CRUD operations on Heart entity instances that represent a beating heart.	
o	React is used for the front-end display, retrieves the data using RESTful API’s and displays the beating heart. User can Add new heart and changes the information such as position, beat count, size, etc. 
o	Back end is done in NetBeans using glassfish server a proper set of JSF pages to do CRUD operations on Heart instances, and it will implement an HTTP RESTful API Project 
o	makes use of Tiered applications (Presentation layer, Business layer, Data layer)
o	Performs Authentication on RESTful API and JSF pages. 
o	Testing is done using Junit and selenium testing. 
•	 Digital counter (Assembly, Dragon 12 Simulator)
•	 3D Pong Game (C++, Unreal engine): 
o	A 3D pong game made in Unreal Engine using C++ 
o	The game uses AI opponent and keeps score of each side and displays them using a HUD.
•	 Color Shooter (C++, Unreal engine)
o	The game consists of two enemy spawners located on two sides of the map, each of a different type. 
o	Players can shoot two types of projectiles, red and yellow. Game recognizes hit by using an Enum to differentiate between types of objects. 
o	If an enemy reaches the player, the hp bar displayed on the game will decrease. 
•	 Calculator (Java, swing): 
o	A GUI calculator made in eclipse using java and swing library, program calculates the string entry using recursions and regular expressions.
